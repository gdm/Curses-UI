TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

- Pasting a lot of data repeatingly and fast can
  cause some recursion error (seen on Linux but
  I have been unable to reproduce this error).
  It is for sure somewhere in the pasting routine.

- Add some kind of -mask functionality to the TextEntry widget.

- See if the TextEditor can be improved to work better with large files.
  Right now the display- and wrapping code is slowing down the editor.

- Work out the way the hiding of widgets works. Now there is some
  support, but it's not really finished yet.

- Add more events to the widgets, so more callbacks can be made.
  
- Replace the current -callback system with some kind of timer 
  system.

- New Label facilities (multi lines) in CheckBox and dialogs.

- finish calendar widget docs.
  add basic_test for calendar widget.
