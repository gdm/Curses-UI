BUGS:
=====

- Curses on solaris will have output frozen if keypresses
  arive during updating or drawing or so. It's best seen in the
  progressbar dialog demo. If you press a key halfway, the
  screen will freeze. The application hower, will continue
  running! ---> bug in curses that was shipped with the
  system. Using ncurses -> OK! I do not know if there is
  a workaround for this.

TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

- Pasting a lot of data repeatingly and fast can
  cause some recursion error (seen on Linux but
  I have been unable to reproduce this error).
  It is for sure somewhere in the pasting routine.

- Add some kind of -mask functionality to the TextEntry widget.

- See if the TextEditor can be improved to work better with large files.
  Right now the display- and wrapping code is slowing down the editor.

- Work out the way the hiding of widgets works. Now there is some
  support, but it's not really finished yet. Or I just don't get
  it myself yet :-)

- Move root(), parent() and rootscr() from Common.pm to Widget.pm?

- Make the listbox scrollable to the right (or have the current
  selected entry scroll to the right if requested).

- Create a treeview widget. 

- Create a table view widget.

- Build a website for Curses::UI

- Enable shortcuts for the Menubar (this is now possible with the
  new event distribution scheme)

- Color support would be nice.

- Resizing ... barhhhhghgh.....

- Make Label wrap text, but add no scrolling if there's to
  much text.

- Create textentry dialog.

- Mouse support:
  - make scrollbars interactive 
  - mouse in texteditor to clickposition for multi line editors
  - doubleclick on file in FileBrowser dialog may close the dialog.

- Extend the Menubar:
  - disabled menuitems
  - separator lines
  - checkboxed optionmenus
  - etc.
