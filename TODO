TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

- Pasting a lot of data repeatingly and fast can
  cause some recursion error (seen on Linux but
  I have been unable to reproduce this error).
  It is for sure somewhere in the pasting routine.

- Add some kind of -mask functionality to the TextEntry widget.

- See if the TextEditor can be improved to work better with large files.
  Right now the display- and wrapping code is slowing down the editor.

- Work out the way the hiding of widgets works. Now there is some
  support, but it's not really finished yet. Or I just don't get
  it myself yet :-)

- Replace the current -callback system with some kind of timer 
  system.

- Move root(), parent() and rootscr() from Common.pm to Widget.pm?

- Make Popupmenu a Label descendant. This makes the widget a bit
  more simple and it makes perfect sense to do so (it didn't back
  then when I created it, but now I'm wondering why :-).
