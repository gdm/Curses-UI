TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

- More tests.... every widget needs its own test!

- Listbox, Popupmenu don't have something like a addItem function
  you always have to reset all values (Listbox) or no chance at
  all (Popmenu, Menubar?).

- The documentation is still very outdated, patches welcome !

- The TODO List for the color support is in COLOR_TODO
