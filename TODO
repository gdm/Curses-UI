TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

- Pasting a lot of data repeatingly and fast can
  cause some recursion error (seen on Linux but
  I have been unable to reproduce this error).
  It is for sure somewhere in the pasting routine.

- Add some kind of -mask functionality to the TextEntry widget.

- Find a nice solution for notifying the user that his/her screen is
  to small to show all the widgets. Right now, the application will just
  die if the screen is to small. Not too good for mission critical 
  applications! 

- See if the TextEditor can be improved to work better with large files.
  Right now the display- and wrapping code is slowing down the editor.
