BUGS:
=====
 
- Curses on solaris will have output frozen if keypresses
  arive during updating or drawing or so. It's best seen in the
  progressbar dialog demo. If you press a key halfway, the
  screen will freeze. The application hower, will continue
  running! ---> bug in curses that was shipped with the
  system. Using ncurses -> OK! I do not know if there is
  a workaround for this.

TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

The documentation is still very outdated, patches welcome !

As this module is not developed any further, look at the new Curses::UI
2.0 interface.
