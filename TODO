TODO list for Curses::UI:
=========================

	- More documentation
	- Make menubar more configureable (i.e. subwidgets own
	  color)
	- Dialog widgets are not filled with the color
	- Default color for Widgets if color support is turned on,
	  e.g. Red error widgets...
	- The colors are not really what they seem to be, e.g. yellow
	  is more brown. Maybe I'll redefine some colors in the future
	- Move BUGS and TODO to googlecode
