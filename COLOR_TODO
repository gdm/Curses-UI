What works:
	- Label
	- TextViewer (Only filled lines)
	- TextEditor 
        - TextEntry
        - Dialog Widgets (only the text)
	- Listbox (with a small hole between selection and text)
	- Window Borders
	- Scrollbars
	- Title Bar colors
	- Progress bar widget
	- Dialogs
		+ Error
		+ Status
		+ Progress	
		+ Filebrowser
		+ Calendar
	- Menubars and Menuentries
	- Button colors

TODO:
	- More documentation
	- Make menubar more configureable (i.e. subwidgets own
	  color)
	- Dialog widgets are not filled with the color

General considerations:
	- Default color for Widgets if color support is turned on,
	  e.g. Red error widgets...

	- The colors are not really what they seem to be, e.g. yellow
	  is more brown. Maybe I'll redefine some colors in the future
