Version 0.54
============

2002-01-04:	- Some small changes in the examples and a new example
                  (basic_test) added.

		- Added -show_hidden option to the FileBrowser.

		- Added ~ keybinding to the FileBrowser. If ~ is pressed in the
		  directory- or filebrowser, the FileBrowser will go to the 
		  homedirectory of the current user.

		- If at creation time of the FileBrowser, the -path is 
                  not defined, the FileBrowser will start at the 
                  homedirectory of the user.

                - The Curses::UI::Frame class is now called Curses::UI::Widget.

                - Solved a bug in Curses::UI::Common::delallwin() which
                  caused a segmentation fault on some systems (by doing
                  a delwin on an already deleted curses window).
               
                - Made a test.pl to test the loading of all classes.

                - Updated Makefile.PL, so required modules are checked.

                - Made a start on documenting Curses::UI. The first bit
                  of documentation is in Curses::UI::Widget. More will
                  follow.
