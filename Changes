Changelog for the Curses::UI distribution:

Version 0.63
============

2001-01-16:     - Added a CLASS HIERARCHY section to the 
                  documentation of each Curses::UI class.

                - All focusable objects now have the following 
                  event callbacks:
                  -onfocus / onFocus()
                  -onblur  / onBlur()

                - The Curses::UI::Calendar widget now fully
                  supports the years 0 - 9999, including the
                  transition from the Julian to the Gregorian
                  calendar (september 1752). This beats the
                  use of timelocal/localtime (which would 
                  currently only support 1900 - 2038 IIRC).

                - Added intellidraw() method to Curses::UI::Widget.
                  If this method is called, the widget is redrawn, but
                  only if it's visible (not hidden and in topwindow)
                  and if intellidraw is enabled (-intellidraw data 
                  member has a true value).

                  This routine can be used to be able to redraw 
                  widgets on a status change, without having to figure
                  out yourself if this wouldn't clutter up the screen.
                  The -intellidraw option is meant for widget
                  builders (see for example the Checkbox code).

                - Incorporated intellidraw() method in:
                  - Curses::UI::Window
                  - Curses::UI::Label
                  - Curses::UI::Calendar
                  - Curses::UI::Buttonbox
                  - Curses::UI::Listbox (+ descendants)
                  - Curses::UI::Checkbox
                  - Curses::UI::Popupbox
                  - Curses::UI::Progressbar
                  - Curses::UI::TextEditor (+ descendants)
                  - Curses::UI::SearchEntry

                - Added a little example application to demonstrate
                  the new intellidraw feature: examples/demo-intellidraw 

2001-01-15:     - Changed the displaying of the calendar widget
                  a little. The topbar showing a date is only 
                  highlighted if the cursor is on the selected date.
	
                - Renamed some widgets (now we still can). I think
                  there are too many capitals in them...
                  - Curses::UI::ListBox renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Listbox
                  - Curses::UI::CheckBox renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Checkbox
                  - Curses::UI::MenuBar renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Menubar
                  - Curses::UI::MenuListBox renamed to
                    Curses::UI::MenuListbox
                  - Curses::UI::PopupBox renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Popupmenu
                  - Curses::UI::ProgressBar renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Progressbar
                  - Curses::UI::ButtonBox renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Buttonbox
                  - Curses::UI::RadioButtonBox renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Radiobuttonbox
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::FileBrowser renamed to
                    Curses::UI::Dialog::Filebrowser

                - Added event callbacks to:
                  - Curses::UI::Calendar      (-onchange / onChange())
                  - Curses::UI::Listbox       (-onchange / onChange())
                  - Curses::UI::Checkbox      (-onchange / onChange())
                  - Curses::UI::TextEditor    (-onchange / onChange())
                  - Curses::UI::TextEntry     (-onchange / onChange())
                  - Curses::UI::PasswordEntry (-onchange / onChange())
                  - Curses::UI::Popupmenu     (-onchange / onChange())


                - The options that can be passed to the new()
                  methods, are case insensitive now. So it is
                  perfectly okay to write:
  
                  $win->add(
                      'cb', 'Checkbox',
                      -Label => 'Demonstration widget',
                      -onChange => sub { exit() } 
                  );


Version 0.62
============

2001-01-14:     - Changed the Label widget. The text to
                  show on the widget may contain more than
                  one line of text (so newline characters
                  may be used). The status-dialog is changed
                  accordingly. Other widgets that use Labels
                  are not updated yet.

                - Updated Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress for
                  use with the new Label widget.

                - Fixed a layout bug in Curses::UI::Widget
                  (the available height and width were 
                  incorrectly computed when using negative
                  -x and -y offsets).

                - Renamed Curses::UI::Buttons to 
                  Curses::UI::Buttonbox, which is more like
                  the naming of the rest of the widget set.
                  Updated all examples and wigets for this
                  change.

                - Fixed some undefined value warnings in
                  Curses::UI::Dialog::Filebrowser.

                - Incorporated multi-line label support in
                  the checkbox widget.

                - Added new widgets + documentation:
                  - Curses::UI::PasswordEntry
                  - Curses::UI::Calendar
                
		- Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Calendar

2001-01-13:     - Changed the way the buttons are defined
                  in Curses::UI::Buttons (all information
                  is now in the -buttons option and there
                  are predefined button types).
                  The documentation for Curses::UI::Buttons
                  is updated.

                - Buttons can now have a -onpress event assigned
                  to them. This callback will execute after
                  the button is pressed and before the focus
                  is lost.

                - All examples are updated for the changed
                  Curses::UI::Buttons class.

                - Solved a warning for some versions of
                  perl about a prototype.

                - Fixed some documentation typos.

Version 0.61
============

2001-01-13:     - Extended the examples/basic_test file
                  to test the functionality of the basic 
                  widgets (for now: Label, Buttons, 
                  Checkbox, Listbox, Popupbox, 
                  Progressbar and TextEditor). Directly
                  derived widgets are not tested (like
                  Radiobuttonbox and TextEntry) because
                  these will most probably work like
                  they should if the base class is okay.

                - Changed the structure of the checkbox
                  widget. The layout() method would each
                  time re-add the label widget to the
                  checkbox widget. Now the checkbox is 
                  a container derivate which always
                  contains the label.

                - Fixed bug: The TextEditor class and
                  derivates didn't call check_for_resize()
                  during focus, so screen resize was
                  not detected.
         

2001-01-12:     - Fixed some broken links in the
                  documentation.

                - Removed "use Carp qw(confess)" from
                  the modules which do not use this
                  (anymore).

                - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Basic
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Error
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Filebrowser
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Status

                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Filebrowser
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Status

                - Added the -clear_on_exit option
                  to Curses::UI. If this option is
                  set, a Curses::UI application will
                  call "clear" on exit.


Version 0.60
============

2001-01-11:     - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::MenuListbox 
                  - Curses::UI::Menubar 

                - Added new example application:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Menubar

2001-01-10:     - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::TextEditor 
                  - Curses::UI::TextEntry 
                  - Curses::UI::TextViewer 
                  - Curses::UI::Common 
                  - Curses::UI::Container 
                  
                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Basic
                  - demo-Curses::UI::TextEditor

                - New option for Curses::UI::Label: -paddingspaces


2001-01-09:     - If the screen is too small for the application
                  to show, the program will no longer die.
                  Now it will show a message telling the user
                  that the screen should be bigger. 

                - Added the -compat option and compat() method
                  to Curses::UI. If -compat is set to a true
                  value, the Curses::UI widgets will be draw
                  using only basic characters, which should be
                  available on all terminals. This might be 
                  a good option for terminals which do not 
                  have characters like ACS_VLINE and ACS_HLINE.

                - Changed the -viewmode of Curses::UI::TextEditor
                  to -readonly.

                - The setpos() method of Curses::UI::Progressbar
                  has been renamed to pos(). The options 
                  -showpercentage and -showcenterline have been
                  changed to -nopercentage and -nocenterline.

                - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::Popupbox
                  - Curses::UI::Progressbar
                  - Curses::UI::SearchEntry 
                  - Curses::UI::Searchable 
                
                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Popupbox
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Progressbar

2001-01-08:     - Deleted last references to the old mws (Maurice's
                  Widget Set) namespace from the modules.

                - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::Checkbox
                  - Curses::UI::Label
                  - Curses::UI::Listbox

                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Checkbox
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Label
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Listbox


Version 0.56
============

2001-01-07:     - Added new example applications: 
                  - hello_world
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Buttons
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress
                  - pop3_reader: a simple POP3 mail reader

		- Wrote documentation for Curses::UI::Buttons

		- New constants in Common.pm: KEY_TAB, KEY_SPACE

                - Moved the following methods from Common.pm to
                  Widget.pm:
                  - clear_binding()
                  - set_routine()
                  - set_binding()
                  - process_bindings()
                  - generic_focus()

2002-01-07:     - Dialogs are moved to their own namespace:
                  Curses::UI::Dialog.

                - Curses::UI has two new filebrowser dialog methods:
                  loadfilebrowser() and savefilebrowser(). These 
                  are filebrowser dialogs which are setup correctly
                  for loading and saving files. The savefilebrowser()
                  will also check if the file to save to does exist.
                  If it does it will show a confirmation dialog to
                  have the user confirm that the file may be 
                  overwritten.

                - The code for centering a Window is now in the
                  Curses::UI::Window class. If the option -centered
                  is set, the layout() method will center the 
                  Window.

                - The add() routines of the classes Curses::UI and 
                  Curses::UI::Container will not also accept
                  "Dialog::*" as a shortcut for "Curses::UI::Dialog::*".

                - Added a new dialog: Curses::UI::Dialog::Status and
                  added documentation and and example to Curses::UI.

                - Added a new dialog: Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress and
                  added documentation and and example to Curses::UI.

                - Curses::UI applications will now automatically 
                  clear the screen on exit (by calling the 'clear'
                  program using a safe $PATH).


Version 0.55
============

2002-01-06:     - Instead of: 
                    $thingy->add('id', 'Curses::UI::WidgetType', %args)
                  You may now also write:
                    $thingy->add('id', 'WidgetType', %args)
                  If there are no double colons in the class name,
                  the sofware assumes the class is in Curses::UI.

                - Wrote documentation for Curses::UI.

                - Fixed some small bugs and did some code cleanup.


2002-01-05:     - Included basic_test in test.pl, so a real use of the
                  package is tested.

                - The Curses::UI::RootWindow does not exist anymore.
                  Now the rootlevel for Curses::UI is created using
                  "my $cui = new Curses::UI".

                - Finished first version of documentation for 
                  Curses::UI::Widget.

Version 0.54
============

2002-01-04:	- Some small changes in the examples and a new example
                  (basic_test) added.

		- Added -show_hidden option to the Filebrowser.

		- Added ~ keybinding to the Filebrowser. If ~ is pressed in the
		  directory- or filebrowser, the Filebrowser will go to the 
		  homedirectory of the current user.

		- If at creation time of the Filebrowser, the -path is 
                  not defined, the Filebrowser will start at the 
                  homedirectory of the user.

                - The Curses::UI::Frame class is now called Curses::UI::Widget.

                - Solved a bug in Curses::UI::Common::delallwin() which
                  caused a segmentation fault on some systems (by doing
                  a delwin on an already deleted curses window).
               
                - Made a test.pl to test the loading of all classes.

                - Updated Makefile.PL, so required modules are checked.

                - Made a start on documenting Curses::UI. The first bit
                  of documentation is in Curses::UI::Widget. More will
                  follow.

Version 0.53
============

2002-01-03:	- Initial import to CPAN.
