Changelog for the Curses::UI distribution:

Version 0.61
============

2001-01-13:     - Extended the examples/basic_test file
                  to test the functionality of the basic 
                  widgets (for now: Label, Buttons, 
                  CheckBox, ListBox, PopupBox, 
                  ProgressBar and TextEditor). Directly
                  derived widgets are not tested (like
                  RadioButtonBox and TextEntry) because
                  these will most probably work like
                  they should if the base class is okay.

                - Changed the structure of the checkbox
                  widget. The layout() method would each
                  time re-add the label widget to the
                  checkbox widget. Now the checkbox is 
                  a container derivate which always
                  contains the label.

                - Fixed bug: The TextEditor class and
                  derivates didn't call check_for_resize()
                  during focus, so screen resize was
                  not detected.
         

2001-01-12:     - Fixed some broken links in the
                  documentation.

                - Removed "use Carp qw(confess)" from
                  the modules which do not use this
                  (anymore).

                - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Basic
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Error
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::FileBrowser
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress
                  - Curses::UI::Dialog::Status

                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::FileBrowser
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Status

                - Added the -clear_on_exit option
                  to Curses::UI. If this option is
                  set, a Curses::UI application will
                  call "clear" on exit.


Version 0.60
============

2001-01-11:     - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::MenuListBox 
                  - Curses::UI::MenuBar 

                - Added new example application:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::MenuBar

2001-01-10:     - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::TextEditor 
                  - Curses::UI::TextEntry 
                  - Curses::UI::TextViewer 
                  - Curses::UI::Common 
                  - Curses::UI::Container 
                  
                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Basic
                  - demo-Curses::UI::TextEditor

                - New option for Curses::UI::Label: -paddingspaces


2001-01-09:     - If the screen is too small for the application
                  to show, the program will no longer die.
                  Now it will show a message telling the user
                  that the screen should be bigger. 

                - Added the -compat option and compat() method
                  to Curses::UI. If -compat is set to a true
                  value, the Curses::UI widgets will be draw
                  using only basic characters, which should be
                  available on all terminals. This might be 
                  a good option for terminals which do not 
                  have characters like ACS_VLINE and ACS_HLINE.

                - Changed the -viewmode of Curses::UI::TextEditor
                  to -readonly.

                - The setpos() method of Curses::UI::ProgressBar
                  has been renamed to pos(). The options 
                  -showpercentage and -showcenterline have been
                  changed to -nopercentage and -nocenterline.

                - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::PopupBox
                  - Curses::UI::ProgressBar
                  - Curses::UI::SearchEntry 
                  - Curses::UI::Searchable 
                
                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::PopupBox
                  - demo-Curses::UI::ProgressBar

2001-01-08:     - Deleted last references to the old mws (Maurice's
                  Widget Set) namespace from the modules.

                - Wrote documentation for:
                  - Curses::UI::CheckBox
                  - Curses::UI::Label
                  - Curses::UI::ListBox

                - Added new example applications:
                  - demo-Curses::UI::CheckBox
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Label
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Listbox


Version 0.56
============

2001-01-07:     - Added new example applications: 
                  - hello_world
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Buttons
                  - demo-Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress
                  - pop3_reader: a simple POP3 mail reader

		- Wrote documentation for Curses::UI::Buttons

		- New constants in Common.pm: KEY_TAB, KEY_SPACE

                - Moved the following methods from Common.pm to
                  Widget.pm:
                  - clear_binding()
                  - set_routine()
                  - set_binding()
                  - process_bindings()
                  - generic_focus()

2002-01-07:     - Dialogs are moved to their own namespace:
                  Curses::UI::Dialog.

                - Curses::UI has two new filebrowser dialog methods:
                  loadfilebrowser() and savefilebrowser(). These 
                  are filebrowser dialogs which are setup correctly
                  for loading and saving files. The savefilebrowser()
                  will also check if the file to save to does exist.
                  If it does it will show a confirmation dialog to
                  have the user confirm that the file may be 
                  overwritten.

                - The code for centering a Window is now in the
                  Curses::UI::Window class. If the option -centered
                  is set, the layout() method will center the 
                  Window.

                - The add() routines of the classes Curses::UI and 
                  Curses::UI::Container will not also accept
                  "Dialog::*" as a shortcut for "Curses::UI::Dialog::*".

                - Added a new dialog: Curses::UI::Dialog::Status and
                  added documentation and and example to Curses::UI.

                - Added a new dialog: Curses::UI::Dialog::Progress and
                  added documentation and and example to Curses::UI.

                - Curses::UI applications will now automatically 
                  clear the screen on exit (by calling the 'clear'
                  program using a safe $PATH).


Version 0.55
============

2002-01-06:     - Instead of: 
                    $thingy->add('id', 'Curses::UI::WidgetType', %args)
                  You may now also write:
                    $thingy->add('id', 'WidgetType', %args)
                  If there are no double colons in the class name,
                  the sofware assumes the class is in Curses::UI.

                - Wrote documentation for Curses::UI.

                - Fixed some small bugs and did some code cleanup.


2002-01-05:     - Included basic_test in test.pl, so a real use of the
                  package is tested.

                - The Curses::UI::RootWindow does not exist anymore.
                  Now the rootlevel for Curses::UI is created using
                  "my $cui = new Curses::UI".

                - Finished first version of documentation for 
                  Curses::UI::Widget.

Version 0.54
============

2002-01-04:	- Some small changes in the examples and a new example
                  (basic_test) added.

		- Added -show_hidden option to the FileBrowser.

		- Added ~ keybinding to the FileBrowser. If ~ is pressed in the
		  directory- or filebrowser, the FileBrowser will go to the 
		  homedirectory of the current user.

		- If at creation time of the FileBrowser, the -path is 
                  not defined, the FileBrowser will start at the 
                  homedirectory of the user.

                - The Curses::UI::Frame class is now called Curses::UI::Widget.

                - Solved a bug in Curses::UI::Common::delallwin() which
                  caused a segmentation fault on some systems (by doing
                  a delwin on an already deleted curses window).
               
                - Made a test.pl to test the loading of all classes.

                - Updated Makefile.PL, so required modules are checked.

                - Made a start on documenting Curses::UI. The first bit
                  of documentation is in Curses::UI::Widget. More will
                  follow.

Version 0.53
============

2002-01-03:	- Initial import to CPAN.
