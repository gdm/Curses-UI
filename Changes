Changelog for the Curses::UI distribution:


Version 0.55
============

2002-01-06:     - Instead of: 
                    $thingy->add('id', 'Curses::UI::WidgetType', %args)
                  You may now also write:
                    $thingy->add('id', 'WidgetType', %args)
                  If there are no double colons in the class name,
                  the sofware assumes the class is in Curses::UI.

                - Made documentation for Curses::UI.

                - Fixed some small bugs and did some code cleanup.


2002-01-05:     - Included basic_test in test.pl, so a real use of the
                  package is tested.

                - The Curses::UI::RootWindow does not exist anymore.
                  Now the rootlevel for Curses::UI is created using
                  "my $cui = new Curses::UI".

                - Finished first version of documentation for 
                  Curses::UI::Widget.

Version 0.54
============

2002-01-04:	- Some small changes in the examples and a new example
                  (basic_test) added.

		- Added -show_hidden option to the FileBrowser.

		- Added ~ keybinding to the FileBrowser. If ~ is pressed in the
		  directory- or filebrowser, the FileBrowser will go to the 
		  homedirectory of the current user.

		- If at creation time of the FileBrowser, the -path is 
                  not defined, the FileBrowser will start at the 
                  homedirectory of the user.

                - The Curses::UI::Frame class is now called Curses::UI::Widget.

                - Solved a bug in Curses::UI::Common::delallwin() which
                  caused a segmentation fault on some systems (by doing
                  a delwin on an already deleted curses window).
               
                - Made a test.pl to test the loading of all classes.

                - Updated Makefile.PL, so required modules are checked.

                - Made a start on documenting Curses::UI. The first bit
                  of documentation is in Curses::UI::Widget. More will
                  follow.

Version 0.53
============

2002-01-03:	- Initial import to CPAN.
