This package uses MakeMaker in a standard way to build its Makefile.
In order to build it do the following:

1. Unpack the source into a directory

2. change the current directory to the source directory

3. run "perl Makefile.PL"

4. run "make"

5. run "make install" as someone who can write to your Perl library
   directory.
