Curses::UI installation:
========================

You will need to have the Curses and Term::ReadKey packages installed
before installing Curses::UI. I recommend compiling Curses against
the ncurses library.

The current version of Curses.pm (1.07) has a bug if compiled with Perl 5.8.
Take a look to http://cpan.thiesenweb.de to get a patch. A new Version
of Curses.pm is expected to be released soon.

This package uses MakeMaker in a standard way to build its Makefile. 
In order to build it do the following:

1. Unpack the source into a directory
2. change the current directory to the source directory
3. run "perl Makefile.PL"
4. run "make"
5. run "make test" or "make test INTERACTIVE_TEST=1" if you
   want to test Curses::UI using an interactive program
6. run "make install"

Example:

$ gunzip Curses-UI-x.xx.tar.gz
$ tar xf Curses-UI-x.xx.tar.gz
$ cd Curses-UI-x.xx
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test INTERACTIVE_TEST=1
$ make install
