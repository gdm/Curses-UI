Curses::UI installation:
========================

You will need to have the Curses and Term::ReadKey packages installed
before installing Curses::UI. I recommend compiling Curses against
the ncurses library.

This package uses MakeMaker in a standard way to build its Makefile. 
In order to build it do the following:

1. Unpack the source into a directory
2. Change the current directory to the source directory
3. Run "perl Makefile.PL"
4. Run "make"
5. Run "make test"
6. Optionally, run "./example/demo-widgets" for an interactive test
7. Run "make install"

Example:

$ tar -xvf Curses-UI-x.xx.tar.gz
$ cd Curses-UI-x.xx
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ ./examples/demo-widgets
$ make install
