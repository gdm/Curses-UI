Curses::UI installation:
========================

Curses::UI depends on the Curses and Term::ReadKey packages. The
installer will volunteer to take care of this for you via the CPAN,
but you may wish to handle it through your package manager.

Installation is the usual:

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make test
> # Optionally, "./example/demo-widgets" for an interactive test
> sudo make install
