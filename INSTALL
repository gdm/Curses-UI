You will need to have the Curses and Term::ReadKey packages installed
before installing Curses::UI. This package uses MakeMaker in a 
standard way to build its Makefile. In order to build it do the 
following:

1. Unpack the source into a directory
2. change the current directory to the source directory
3. run "perl Makefile.PL"
4. run "make"
5. run "make test" 
6. run "make install"

Example:

$ gunzip Curses-UI-x.xx.tar.gz
$ tar xf Curses-UI-x.xx.tar.gz
$ cd Curses-UI-x.xx
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ make install
